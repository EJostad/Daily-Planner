# Daily-Planner

This is a scheduling application that will allow the user to save events to specific hours on the current day. 

The save functionality utilises local storage within the browser, and retrieves that stored data when the page 

reloads for a persistant and reliable schedule. 

The application utilises moment.js for most of the heavy-lifting, and all for obtaining real time date and time.
